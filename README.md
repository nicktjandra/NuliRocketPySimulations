Simulations of the upcoming November launch of the Northeastern University Launch Initiative rocket. We used RocketPy as a third method of validation. The rocket was modeled to match the OpenRocket and RASAero II inputs.

The flight of the vehicle is graphed to show how far it will drift and the maximum altitude it will reach. The apogee is 4599 ft, which is higher than the OpenRocket simulation but lower than the RASAero II simulation. As described previously, the team will investigate which software simulates apogee the best for the Subscale flight. In addition to the apogee, the drift distance was found to be 1512ft for typical wind conditions at the launch site.

The stability caliber at rail exit is 2.68, which is similar to the other simulated values of calibers. The value of the caliber was graphed for the burn time of the motor, which is 3.5 seconds.
